# Portfolio

## AUTHOR

## CONCEPT
I updated my portfolio to have a more simple aesthetic. I've also added more recent projects and will be adding more soon.

## Site information Display
  * Home page that changes background color every 8 seconds (home page only)
  * About me
  * My projects
  * Contact form

## Process
  ### Front End Development
  * Used HTML, CSS, and Booststrap
  * Used Bootstrap primarily for row/col alignment, centering, spacing, and text    color.
  * Used css to tweak spacing, background color, spacing between main-content and footer, and more.
    
  ### Back End Development
  * I used jQuery to render project images and modals dynamically. My project information are stored in an object in the index.js file that will generate the appropriate number of project displays and modals based on the number of projects in the projects object. This was done to keep the code as non repetitive as possible. The index.html file would have been significantly longer if I coded all project containers and modals directly.

### Technologies used:  
  HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery

### I doesn't change color dynamically in real time (will work on that maybe)
